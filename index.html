Privacy Policy
Introduction
Welcome to Brain Buzz (‚Äúwe,‚Äù ‚Äúour,‚Äù or ‚Äúus‚Äù). Your privacy is our top priority. We are committed to ensuring that your personal information remains private, safe, and secure.

Brain Buzz is a cognitive retraining application designed to help users improve cognitive functions through interactive exercises. We believe in a privacy-first approach, which means we do not collect, store, or share any personal data from users.

This Privacy Policy outlines our stance on privacy, the security measures in place, and your rights regarding the use of our app.

1. Information We Do Not Collect
Brain Buzz is built with privacy in mind, and as such, we do not collect:

1.1. Personal Information
We do not require or store your name, email address, phone number, or any personally identifiable information.
1.2. Usage Data
We do not track app usage, session durations, interactions, or feature engagement.
1.3. Health and Cognitive Data
The app does not record, analyze, or transmit any cognitive performance data or progress.
1.4. Device Information
We do not access or collect device-related information such as IP address, OS version, or device model.
1.5. Location Data
Brain Buzz does not track your location, GPS coordinates, or any other geolocation details.
1.6. Payment Information
The app does not process payments or store financial data, as it does not have in-app purchases or subscriptions.
2. Offline Functionality
Brain Buzz operates entirely on your device. All exercises, training modules, and progress tracking are stored locally. No internet connection is required to use the app, and no data is transmitted to external servers.

3. Third-Party Services
Brain Buzz does not integrate with third-party services such as analytics, advertisements, cloud storage, or external APIs. This ensures that your activity remains private and secure at all times.

4. Security and Data Protection
Even though Brain Buzz does not collect data, we prioritize security in the following ways:

Local Storage Security: All data remains on your device and is not accessible to us.
No Data Transmission: The app does not send or receive any data over the internet.
No Third-Party Access: We do not share data with advertisers, marketers, or third-party vendors.
While we have implemented best practices for security, we recommend that users follow general security guidelines, such as keeping their device updated and avoiding third-party modifications of the app.

5. Children's Privacy
Brain Buzz is designed for general audiences and does not collect any personal information. Since we do not store or process any data, the app fully complies with child privacy laws such as COPPA (Children‚Äôs Online Privacy Protection Act) and GDPR-K (General Data Protection Regulation for Kids).

If a parent or guardian has concerns about their child's use of the app, they may contact us at [Your Contact Email].

6. Your Privacy Rights
Since Brain Buzz does not collect any data, you do not need to request access, modification, or deletion of your data. However, if you have any privacy concerns or questions, you are welcome to contact us.

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy if our practices change in the future. If any modifications are made, they will be reflected within the app, and we will ensure transparency about any changes.
